  <title>Ogden Farmers' Library Online Code of Conduct (Updated 1-16-2025)</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Online Code of Conduct</h1>
  <p>Any illegal use of the Internet is strictly prohibited. Illegal uses include, but are not limited to, the viewing of child pornography, infringement of copyright, credit card fraud and the sending of libelous and/or harassing messages. Illegal activity observed in the library will result in being banned and be reported to the police immediately.
<br><br>
Patrons are in a public place and therefore must respect the rights of others by not displaying on the monitor sexually explicit material and images that are likely to prove objectionable to those around you. The library staff reserves the right to end any internet session, ask patrons to leave, and/or bar patrons from return.
<br><br>
The library uses software to reset the computers to a set state after each session. Attempts to add to, remove or in any way alter the hardware and software configurations on the computer or the library network will not be tolerated. If a patron needs a program added temporarily, ask the librarian and they will decide whether or not to do so. A patron may need to come back another day if they need a program added temporarily, as it may involve coordination with the Technology Library Assistant.
<br><br>
When logging in on a computer you will need your library card number and last name or a guest pass. You are allowed two hours of computer use each day. More time may be added at the discretion of the librarian if there are computers unused at the time the extension is requested. The library staff reserves the right to end the session of someone in extended time should it become necessary.
<br><br>
Library computers automatically end your session after the time allotted. Please ask for an extension at least 10 minutes before your time is up. Save your work often as a file will be unrecoverable if the session ends.
The librarian on duty has full discretion over permission to use the computer. If a librarian asks a patron to leave the computers, they must do so.
â€‹<br><br>
Computers shut down 10 minutes before the library closes; this limit is automated and cannot be avoided.
Users must pay for pages printed. Printing costs are set by the Board of Trustees and can be seen in signage near the computers.  Printing is done at the Circulation Desk. After completing your print job, pick up and pay for your prints at the Circulation Desk.
<br><br>
Adopted by the OFL Board of Trustees January 16, 2025</p>
